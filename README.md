## TypeScript

- What is TS and why using it in your project?
  `TypeScript is a superset of the JavaScript language that has a single open-source compiler and is developed mainly by a single vendor: Microsoft. The goal of TypeScript is to help catch mistakes early through a type system and to make JavaScript development more efficient.`
  source: [Stackoverflow - Lodewijk's answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35048303/6521).

- How to configure TS?
